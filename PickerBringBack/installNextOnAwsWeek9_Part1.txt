PART 1 Create a clean new local Expo project for native apps

Instructions to deploy web app on AWS EC2 using next js for SSR of your SPA


First, lets create a clean new local expo project:
The first thing we need to do is to ensure that our web components contain ONLY web
compatible components. MyChart is using the Picker component which isn't web compatible, 
so it need to be re-written. I've already done this (its a bit of a mess at this stage 
and need to be re-written), and I've already uploaded a zipped version of the clean 
project discussed below (nativeNextSsrWebApp.zip). I've also uploaded a zipped version 
of the cleaned up node-js MiniProject too. 

cd c:\expoProjects
expo init nativeNextSsrWebApp
Press return/enter to select default (blank Managed Workflow)

Now, lets check it on web (be patient, it will take a minute or two to start): 
cd nativeNextSsrWebApp
expo start -w
and make sure you see it running on localhost:19006
Hit CTRL C to exit back to the shell. Kill the associated browser tabs. 

Now, lets add our existing app with the MyPicker amd MyChart components: 
- in Atom (or your preferred IDE):
  - File -> Add Project Folder 
  - select nativeNextSsrWebApp
- copy MyChart.js, MyChart.native.js, MyPicket.js, MyPicket.native.js, data.js
- paste them into nativeNextSsrWebApp
- delete App.js in nativeNextSsrWebApp, and then copy in the new App.js from our previous project
- now, when we look into these 5 files to see what we need to install, we find:
  - react-native-scrollable-tab-view
  - react-native-chart-kit
  - @babel/polyfill
  - react-native-svg
  - @react-navigation/native
  - @react-navigation/stack
- so, in the shell, make sure you're still in the nativeNextSsrWebApp directory and type: 
  npm install --save react-native-svg 
  npm install --save react-native-scrollable-tab-view
  npm install --save @react-navigation/native
  npm install --save @react-navigation/stack
  npm install --save react-native-chart-kit
  npm install --save @babel/polyfill
- check it on web (be patient, it will take a minute or two to start): 
  - expo start -w

Ok, it should work BUT it's not connecting back to database. So, you'll need to run node and mongo. 
I've created a minimal folder for this (MiniProject zipped) so download it. Backup your old MiniProject 
if there is anything you need in there and then copy over the new one that you just downloaded. I'm 
assuming you have already downloaded the nodejs folder which contains an executable for mongo, so open a 
new shell and type:
cmd /k C:\nodejs\installs\mongodb-win32-x86_64-2008plus-ssl-4.0.3\bin\mongod
open a new shell and:
- cd c:\nodejs\MiniProject
npm start
Check it by looking at localhost:8000
Now, lets check it on expo web app (be patient, it will take a minute or two to start): 
cd nativeNextSsrWebApp
expo start -w

Looks like I've re-introduced the bug with the picker not closing! I'll fix it later. But we need to move on:
- lets get it on AWS with support for SSR using nextjs! 
Hit CTRL C to exit back to the shell. Kill the associated browser tabs.
